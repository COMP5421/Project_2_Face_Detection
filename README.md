# Project_2_Face_Detection
This is a face detection program using SIFT-like Histogram of Gradients(HoG) based on [Triggs's paper](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp5421/Password_Only/projects/faces/dalal_triggs_cvpr_2005.pdf).<br>
Multiscale sliding window is adopted to detect potential faces in the testing image.
